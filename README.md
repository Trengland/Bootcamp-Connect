## Description
Our mobile-friendly website is designed to help bootcamp classmates get to know each other more efficiently at the beginning of class.\
A User creates a personal bio upon first login, and this gives them access to other classmates bios - favorite shows, movies, quotes, hobbies, zodiac sign, etc.\



## Usage
Homepage - Create a new account in order to view classmates BIO's, or log in if you've already done so.\
Peers BIO's Page - In a gallery setting, view a small peak at other classmates BIO's and click into each individual to learn more and leave a comment.\
Peer's Indivdual BIO's - The full bio is presented, along with images, contact info, social media links, and a section to leave comments about things you find interesting in their bio.\
Personal BIO page - where you can view and update your own personal bio anytime you want and/or as life changes.\
